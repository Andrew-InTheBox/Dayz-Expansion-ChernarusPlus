# DayZ Chernarusplus with Expansion

Configuration files from ./config and ./mpmissions/Expansion.Chernarusplus for a DayZ server setup, version 1.22, with Expansion bundle and MMG gear.  Includes market trader files and several quests.

##Note - the startup batch file will load any directory starting with "@" as a mod.  Server-side mods have to be named as NOT starting with @.  In my case, I used _XYZ to note serverside mods and just added the one I'm using manually to the startup batch.
